#Hello World ... 

---

This is my the first step in blogging about my journey to becoming a fully fledged developer so best to start with telling you a bit about myself! *Here's the first part of my journey so far ...*

First of all, my name is *Greg Rutherford* I am 28 years old at the time of writing this (29 tomorrow though!) I am from a place just outside of Glasgow, Scotland which is called *Renfrew* & for roughly 10 years after leaving school at the age of 16 I worked as a Pipefitter. Pipefitting definitely was not a calling for me, but it did allow me to save up enough money to move to Australia for 2 years on a working holiday visa which set the wheels in motion for the dream I'm currently chasing. 

Most of my working career as a pipefitter I didn't enjoy the work I was doing. I felt it was boring, didn't challenge me & worst of all the working conditions throughout the industry are horrible. When I moved to Australia I believed that some of those feelings would change, but even with the excellent weather we enjoyed in Perth, the beaches on our doorstep & a whole new exciting city to explore, I still found myself struggling for motivation to get up & work in the morning. Being on the other side of the world feeling the same about my job as I did in gloomy Scotland forced me into having some serious thoughts about what lay ahead for me for the rest of my life. 


During my career soul-searching, I don't know what led me to Software Development but maybe it was fate. I have always been good with computers and new technologies but I wasn't always the best in school. Formal education doesn't exactly agree with me & the way my brain works so I had never seriously considered this career path as I thought it could only be done through University & with me being 25 at the time of seeking a change in career I couldn't see me going that route, but alas I found [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I remember watching a promotional video on FCC about how a career in Software Development could be achieved through self-learning & presented how the industry demands were outgrowing the current talent pool. The video was the first spark for me, after watching it I dived straight into the curriculum which I loved. The interactive nature of the course, learning by actually doing was perfect for me, it kept me focused on what I was working toward & stuff actually sunk in, unlike the days of reading paragraph after paragraph of a textbook in school feeling like I knew less after it than before. 

After spending 6 months in Perth, my girlfriend & I took the trip of a lifetime, renting a campervan to drive over 3000km to Melbourne where we would spend the rest of our 2 years in Australia. Once we settled again in Melbourne I went back to studying. On top of *FreeCodeCamp*, I discovered [*Codecademy*](https://www.codecademy.com/) & [*Learn Python The Hard Way*](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). I would spend some of my free time going between these sites, learning & working on whatever I could to improve myself. Progress was slow, but here I was in Australia on a working-holiday, working full-time, exploring my new surroundings, meeting new friends & trying to change my career somehow. I knew when I returned to Scotland I would have to concentrate on my goal if I wanted to achieve it, but for now, I just had to work on getting **1% better every day...**
