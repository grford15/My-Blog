#The Purpose of this blog & my hopes for it

---

I love simplicity, the simpler the better in my opinion, so the simplest question you can ask is the best. 

##Why?

Why am I doing this blog? Such a simple question but not such a simple answer, but I will try to explore the reasons behind it.

###Accountability

The first reason I think is most important for me personally. Keeping myself accountable while self-learning can be a struggle, it's so easy to spend time learning or practicing for an hour and then believing that I deserve to then take an hours break to watch Game of Thrones. So I originally created this blog because I was solely intent on it being another project for my portfolio, but then what's the point in having a blog with no posts in it? So I have set myself the goal to make at least one blog post a week where I go over what I have worked on & what I intend to work on. 

###To Tell my Story

I have seen plenty of individual posts on forums or individual blogs about people who have changed career and successfully become Software Developers but I haven't seen many journeys documented throughout, perhaps there's a reason for this. At the moment I am not a developer, I don't have any prospect of getting employment at the moment either so I'm shooting my shot with this blog as there's probably a better chance of me failing my goal than achieving it. I can only hope this blog has a happy ending & it will show anyone reading that it is possible. 

###Share Resources

One of my main aims in this blog is to document what I am doing to hopefully become a Software Developer so I will be covering whatever tutorials I follow, website's I'm using or books I'm reading. There are copious YouTube videos, courses & books but it is always nice to get an opinion on them before you dive in, so I'm willing to waste my time on them first so you don't have to. 

###Get a Job 

There's no point kidding on otherwise, one of the main reasons for this is to help me in my goal of getting a job as a developer. Standing out as a developer these days is getting harder with every new graduate & career changer like myself, even though writing a blog isn't exactly original I hope it will help. I want to use this blog to present who I am both as a person and a developer, coding is only a small part of my journey but I want to show all of it.
